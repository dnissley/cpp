Exercise 5.1
============

What is a null statement? When might you use a null statement?

A null statement is a statement that does nothing.

You need to use a null statement where a statement is required but you don't actually want to do any work. For example, the body of any loop must contain a single expression. But if you do all the work in the loop conditions and have no need for a statement you use a null statement as the body of the loop.
