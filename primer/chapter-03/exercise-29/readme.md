Exercise 3.29
=============

The primary drawback of using an array instead of a vector is that arrays must have a length initialized to a constexpr.

Another drawback is that arrays of a built-in type are not default-initialized.

Another drawback is that you don't get all of the utility functions that make vectors so easy to work with, including access to iterators.
