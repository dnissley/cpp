Exercise 6.6
============

Explain the differences between a parameter, a local variable, and a local static variable. Give an example of a function in which each might be useful.

A parameter is a variable that is an input to a function.

A local variable is a variable that is defined in a function body.

A local static variable is like a global variable that is only accessible in the function where it is defined.
