Exercise 2.25
=============

Determine the types and values of each of the following variables.

**(a)** `int* ip, i, &r = i;`

ip is an undefined pointer to an int. 

i is an undefined int. 

r is a reference to i and so it's value is also undefined.

**(b)** `int i, *ip = 0;`

i is an undefined int. 

ip is a null pointer to an int.

**(c)** `int* ip, ip2;`

ip is an undefined pointer to an int.

ip2 is an undefined int.
