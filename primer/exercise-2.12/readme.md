Exercise 2.12
=============

Which, if any, of the following names are **invalid**?

**(a)** `int double = 3.14;`

Invalid because 'double' is a keyword.

**(b)** `int _;`

Valid because it begins with a letter or underscore.

**(c)** `int catch-22;`

Invalid. Although it begins with a letter or underscore the rest of the name doesn't consist of solely letters, digits, and underscores. You can't use a dash in an identifier.

**(d)** `int 1_or_2 = 1;`

Invalid because it begins with a number.

**(e)** `double Double = 3.14;`

Valid. C++ is case sensitive, and although 'double' is a keyword, 'Double' is not.
