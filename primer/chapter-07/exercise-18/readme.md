Exercise 7.18
=============

What is encapsulation? Why is it useful?

Encapsulation is the concept of exposing what a class does without exposing exactly how the code works underneath.

It is useful because exposing the full innerworkings of a class can lead to accidental misuse, and can make working with that class more complex and error-prone.
